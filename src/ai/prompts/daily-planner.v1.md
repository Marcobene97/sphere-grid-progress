## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Mixed Task Types

**Input:**
```json
[
  {"title": "Write design document", "priority": 5, "estimated_time": 90, "energy": "high"},
  {"title": "Code review for team", "priority": 4, "estimated_time": 45, "energy": "medium"},
  {"title": "Answer emails", "priority": 2, "estimated_time": 30, "energy": "low"},
  {"title": "Debug production issue", "priority": 5, "estimated_time": 60, "energy": "high"},
  {"title": "Team standup meeting", "priority": 3, "estimated_time": 15, "energy": "low"}
]
```

**Output:**
```
üåÖ Morning Block (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
‚Ä¢ 9:00 AM - 9:15 AM: Team standup meeting (15 min)
‚Ä¢ 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM: Write design document (90 min)
‚Ä¢ 11:15 AM - 12:00 PM: Debug production issue (45 min, continue after lunch)

üçΩÔ∏è Lunch Break (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)

‚òÄÔ∏è Afternoon Block (1:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
‚Ä¢ 1:00 PM - 1:15 PM: Debug production issue (remaining 15 min)
‚Ä¢ 1:30 PM - 2:15 PM: Code review for team (45 min)
‚Ä¢ 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM: Answer emails (30 min)

üí° Tips:
- High-energy tasks (design doc, debugging) placed in morning when focus is peak
- Meeting scheduled first to clear obligations
- Admin work (emails) saved for afternoon energy dip
- 15-min breaks between major tasks for mental reset
```
